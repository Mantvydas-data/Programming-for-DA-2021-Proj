    "During recent wordwide lockdown it became increasingly popular to have a subscription to one of many movie/TV streaming services. These platforms experienced unprecedented growth month on month basis becoming daily habit for most. This project will look into simulating a dataset of fictional movie streaming platform 'MFLIX' usage log with dates, movie stream count per hour, movie category, user ID, user gender and name with surname. Different methods learned during this semester will be used in this project."
