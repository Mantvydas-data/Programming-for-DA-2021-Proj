<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This repository contains project for Programming for Data Analysis 2021 module. Files include: gitignore file, readme and Jupyter notebook project.ipynb.
Assessment instructions can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/brianmcgmit/ProgDA/raw/master/ProgDAProject.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Problem statement</h3>
<p>For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose. Specifically, in this project you should:</p>
<p>&bull; Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.</p>
<p>&bull; Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.</p>
<p>&bull; Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.</p>
<p>&bull; Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.</p>
<p>Note that this project is about simulation you must synthesise a data set. Some students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay to base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do), but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set. The next section gives an example project idea.</p>

<h3>Libraries and Packages Used</h3>
<p><a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html">Numpy</a> - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html">Matplotlib- Pyplot</a> - Matplotlib.pyplot is a state-based interface to matplotlib, where Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.</p>
<p><a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">Seaborn</a> - Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.</p>
<p><a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Jupyter</a> - JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda</a> - Python based platform for Data Science.</p>

<h3>Running the code</h3>
<p>Assignment has been completed using Python version 3.8.8 that can be downloaded <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a> with Anaconda version 4.10.3 that can be downloaded <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">here</a>. While Python and related libraries-packages can be installed separately it is encouraged to use latest Anaconda distribution that provides a wide variety of data science related tools.</p>
